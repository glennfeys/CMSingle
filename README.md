# CMSingle

CMSingle is an open source cms that uses only one php file as cms. so no db is required. It can only be used with html projects and partially with php projects. But no php will be executed in editing mode (yet).

## Installation

1. Add the admin.php to the directory in your project where you want to edit the html files.
2. Profit ?

## Usage

Choose a password by setting it in the php file (the standard password is admin).

go to {your website here}/admin.php

here you will go to your homepage and you will have an aditional menu on the bottom right showing all webpages in the directory and a save button. If you click on a page you will go to that page in the edit modus. when you press save, the page will be automatically saved in the website.
